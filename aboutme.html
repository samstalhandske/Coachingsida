      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p style="font-family:monospace";> My name is Daniel Tomic Lindvall, I am a 22 year old IPF competitor and coach. My biggest ambition within the fitness world is lifting people up and helping to make them better. </p><br>
      <p style="font-family:monospace";> I began lifting in high school, with my first two years being almost entirely wasted not having a clue about anything. After I hit my first 100kg bench I joined a powerlifting gym. Having elite athletes help me out on a daily basis inspired me to start this coaching journey of mine. I have first hand experience of most programming styles, I've coached elite level lifters at meets, gotten a gold medal in regionals and helped build up insane lifters over the years. </p><br>
      <p style="font-family: monospace";> I began doing tons of research on everything from programming to kinesiology, and I started reaching out to beginners offering them free coaching. Over the years I developed my own style of coaching "in the shadows". I had a loyal base of clients that had gotten incredible results without really trying to sell my services in a public manner.</p><br>
      <p style="font-family: monospace";> In 2020 I did a years worth of anatomy, physiology and training courses at Karolinska Institutet. I was planning to graduate with a degree in physiotherapy and medicine in order to boost my coaching. After a few practises at clinics, I realized physiotherapy was almost entirely about old people with arthritis, and not so much about ambitious athletes with back problems.</p><br>
      <p style="font-family: monospace" style="margin-bottom: 110px";>I dropped out of Karolinska Institutet and decided to make an effort into publicizing my services. So here we are.</p>
