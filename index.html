      <h1>Why get a coach?</h1>
      <p>Having a coach as a beginner lets you skip all the newbie form- and programming issues. Everyone I began training with spent the first year or two getting lackluster results as we slowly learned.</p><br>
      <p>Equipment quality questions? Ask coach. Pin pointing a weakness? Ask coach. Rehabbing an injury? Ask coach. Diet questions? Ask coach. Program questions? Coach. Water cut? Coach. Cardio? Coach. Need a spot on bench day? Coach.</p><br>
      <p>Simply put; anyone who wants to maximize return on the time they invest into training as a beginner/intermediate should have a coach.</p>

          <p>Viktors goal was to gain strength and muscle while staying in the -66kg IPF weight class. There's a 1 year difference between these pictures and bodyweight remains the same. Viktor has benched the unofficial national record for his age and weight; 127,5kg bench at 16 years and 66kg. Due to covid-19 he wasn't able to make it official at a competition. Going forward we are aiming at filling out the -83kg weightclass as he's getting too tall to stay in -66.</p>

          <p>The left picture is me post covid lockdown. I decided to do a body recomposition. I went from 96kg to 83kg in roughly 3 months. Losing fat and adding muscle. I wanted a clean slate to start rebuilding my powerlifting total from. My current goal is to hit my -105kg regional gold medal total weighing below 90kg.</p>
